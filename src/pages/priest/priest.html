          <p text-wrap>Priests are masters of healing, and can heal themselves and their minions through their Hero Power and a range of healing spells, as well as boosting minions' health. Priests' healing theme is reinforced by synergies with spells such as Inner Fire, and minions such as Lightspawn and Northshire Cleric. Priests are capable of strong defensive play, keeping a handful of minions alive against all odds, and quickly regenerating defenders between rounds.</p>
